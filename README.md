# challenge-2

##User Story
AS AN employer
I WANT to view a potential employee's deployed portfolio of work samples
SO THAT I can review samples of their work and assess whether they're a good candidate for an open position

##Acceptance Criteria
Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring manager's needs:

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport

## Description

This project is building my first portfolio to display my projects. Building this portfolio project has helped me gain more skills in how to write HTML and CSS. This my not be the best portfolio out there put its a great start to learn and dive deeper in the world of CSS my someone starting out. While building this i learned more about flex, grid, borders and so on. while doing it i stumbled across other options inside css to style the sheet in ways i didn't think about or know about. Doing the HTML help me with semantic elements. The world of web development has so much to learn and this was a great project to start with.
