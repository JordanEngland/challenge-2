# Jordan England Portfolio

## Description

This project is building my first portfolio to display my projects. Building this portfolio project has helped me gain more skills in how to write HTML and CSS. This my not be the best portfolio out there put its a great start to learn and dive deeper in the world of CSS my someone starting out. While building this i learned more about flex, grid, borders and so on. while doing it i stumbled across other options inside css to style the sheet in ways i didn't think about or know about. Doing the HTML help me with semantic elements. The world of web development has so much to learn and this was a great project to start with.
